# MCP Agent TypeScript Port

## Overview

This is a TypeScript port of the [original MCP Agent framework by lastmile-ai](https://github.com/lastmile-ai/mcp-agent) - a simple, composable framework for building agents using the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

## Motivation

The original MCP Agent was implemented in Python. This port aims to:
- Provide a type-safe implementation
- Leverage TypeScript's strong typing
- Enable easier integration with TypeScript and JavaScript projects
- Maintain the core principles of composable agent workflows

## Features (Work in Progress)

- TypeScript implementation of MCP Agent framework
- Core workflow patterns:
  - AugmentedLLM
  - Parallel
  - Logging
  - Context Management
  - Executor

## Installation

```bash
npm install @waldzell/mcp-agent-ts
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { Agent, AugmentedLLM } from '@waldzell/mcp-agent-ts';

// Example coming soon
```
